# Physical_Robot_Design-Decepticons
This project was undertaken as part of the EN2532 module, focusing on the design and implementation of a robot capable of completing a series of challenging physical tasks. The tasks were divided into four distinct subtasks, each presenting unique challenges:

1.Line Maze: The robot's ability to navigate through a maze with complex line patterns.
2.Curved Wall: Overcoming obstacles in the form of curved walls.      
3.Blind Box: Tackling the challenge of navigating around blind area.    
4.Line Following: Precision tracking and following of lines on the ground.
